## Data sources
Stage 1: 
- Data set was initially randomly seeded from a fictitious data set (approximately 10,000 records per DB table), then consistently associated with that seeding.  (archived)
- Data set included a substantial amount of "dirty data" (bad data), which had to be filtered prior to use. 
Stage 2: 
- Using the legacy data set (mentioned above) Project Deimos sanitized the data and extended the data, generating approximately 60,0000,000 records in five DB tables.
